# Livestream-Color-Switch
I just remade a very popular hyper-casual game on YouTube's live in a hour which is Color Switch!

# Tutorial:
1. First create a 2D Project in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (2020 is recommended)
2. Then clone this repository into a local folder of your computer
3. Import "Assets" folder of the repository into your Unity Project root folder
4. Then load the `SampleScene.unity` file in Unity Engine
5. Star this repository to make sure that works fine ;))))
